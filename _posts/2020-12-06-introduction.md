It is hard for me to go out into the world and participate.

I may go more into this later, but for now, I would like to contribute more to helping other people, primarily through writing, and through code. Education, advocacy, and other things of that nature.

The plan: to start "open-sourcing" myself to the world through: ways to connect with me in dialogue (email, keybase, twitter, fb, github, etc), through writing an assorted blog (hosted on GitHub) with code, project overviews/instructions, recipes, and stories/philosophical musings.

I will need to figure out how to have the ability to cross-post entries to social media accounts with links to the posts, which have links to GitHub, links to page source in md via Github Pages.

This post (and the corresponding work on bringing the site up) is the first effort towards building and maintaining this.
